## Task
The objective of this task was to implement the Sidecar pattern in a Kubernetes environment for shipping access and error logs generated by a web server container running the Nginx image. The logs needed to be available for the last 24 hours to facilitate issue tracing and bug fixing by Nautilus developers. The Sidecar pattern was chosen to separate the concerns of the web server and log shipping functionality. To achieve this, a second container was deployed in the same Pod as the Nginx container, specializing in shipping logs. Both containers shared an emptyDir volume to read and write logs.

## Solution
The following steps were undertaken to implement the Sidecar pattern for log shipping:

1. Created a Pod named "webserver" to host the Nginx and sidecar containers.

2. Created an emptyDir volume named "shared-logs" to store the logs generated by the web server.

3. Deployed two containers in the "webserver" Pod:
   - Nginx container named "nginx-container" running the Nginx image with the latest tag (nginx:latest). This container serves web pages.
   - Sidecar container named "sidecar-container" running the Ubuntu image with the latest tag (ubuntu:latest). This container specializes in shipping logs.

4. Configured the "sidecar-container" to continuously ship the access and error logs from the Nginx container. This was achieved by adding the following command to the sidecar-container:
   
   command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 300; done"]
   

5. Mounted the "shared-logs" volume on both containers at the location /var/log/nginx. This allowed both containers to read and write logs.
